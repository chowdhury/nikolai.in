title: Welcome to nikolai.in, a long time in the making.
---

I've had numerous failed attempts over the years to build out a personal blog of my musings in tech, business, and life in general but after evaluating most of your standard Wordpress, Drupal, Tumblr... approaches it always seemed to be overkill for a no-thrills personal blog. Here's where Jekyll comes into play.

What's under the hood
---------------------
I've been a fan of building out and hosting my own boxes on AWS, but for this experiment, nikolai.in is hosted on [GitHub](http://pages.github.com). Everything is version controlled, and its super simple to edit on the fly with Prose.io. It's running [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/) and all of the posts are written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

About Me
--------
I'm a mobile developer and solution architect from New York, NY. Living in Fanwood, NJ. I've been "working" for more than eleven years with technology, but have been tinkering much longer than that. I've developed and implemented numerous innovative and groundbreaking interactive experiences at [Genwi](http://genwi.com), cloud publshing for mobile, [Women’s Wear Daily](http://wwd.com), a division of Condé Nast Publications, and [Colin Cowie Enterprises](http://colincowieweddings.com), a lifestyle digital media company--in addition to working with the likes of Time Warner Center, Times Music India and Fordham University. 

Apart from skiing, I enjoy being a concert classical pianist and collaborating with my family’s [music production company in India](http://www.morescape.com).

My core has been `javascript`, `html`, `css`, `php`, and visual design, but since I've gone mobile, Objective-C and Phonegap has been my bread and butter.

I love discovering new trends, diving deep into trying the next best thing, and building refined timeless experiences that don't make the user think.

So what's this blog going to be about?
--------------------------------------
Everything any anything. Stay tuned.
