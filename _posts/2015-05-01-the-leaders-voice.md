## The Columbia EMBA Experience & the Leader's Voice

As I'm wrapping up the last few weeks of the Executive MBA Program at [Columbia Business School](http://gsb.columbia.edu/), I've been thinking alot about my experience, the great classes, professors, lifelong connections and friends that have been made during the journey. During the past 2 years, me and my classmates have had a crashcourse in time management, prioritization, and the jump back into academics -- and naturally one of the first things to go was the publication of my personal blog. 

This piece will be the first in a series of retrospectives on the b-school experience, takeaways and lessons learned. I hope it provides some context of what I've ben up to for the last two years, but also proves as a resource for prospective students who come across it.

What's under the hood
---------------------
I've been a fan of building out and hosting my own boxes on AWS (had my share of Network Solutions horror), but for this experiment, nikolai.in is hosted on [GitHub](http://pages.github.com). Everything is version controlled, and its super simple to edit on the fly with [Prose.io](http://prose.io). It's running [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/) and all of the posts are written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).
